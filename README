COMP 770 - PA1
==============

This assignment has three parts, as described in pa1.pdf:
    * Intersections
    * Intersections + shading
    * Intersections + shading + antialiasing

I have provided a Makefile which can be used to build and render images either
individually or all at once. Note that I have only tested this code on Linux
using Ubuntu 14.04.

There are two ways to render the images:
    1. Using OpenGL and GLUT
    2. Writing .ppm files to disk

If you have OpenGL and GLUT installed, ("freeglut3-dev" and "freeglut3" libraries
on Ubuntu 14.04) you can build individual parts (e.g. "make part1-gl") or all at
once ("make gl")

If you don't have OpenGL and GLUT installed, you can still render the images
as .ppm files written to disk, either individually (e.g. "make part1") or all at
once ("make"). 

If you go the non-GL route, there are no external dependencies for this project
other than a C++11 compiler and the standard library. I use OpenMP to shave a
few seconds off the running time of Part 3, but every somewhat-modern C++
compiler will have that capability built-in. Running all three parts shouldn't
take more than a few seconds.

For Part 3, I used uniform sampling instead of random sampling to generate the
64 sample rays within each pixel--the results looked identical, and the uniform
sampling had better performance.

NOTE: I chose .ppm as my image format because it's the easiest format to write 
      to. However, it's possible that the default image viewer in Windows can't 
      open files of that type. I've included .png versions in the "images"
      directory just in case, but keep in mind that the code will still only
      produce .ppm files.
