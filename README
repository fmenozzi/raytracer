COMP 770 - PA1
==============

This assignment has three parts, as described in pa1.pdf:
    * Intersections
    * Intersections + shading
    * Intersections + shading + antialiasing

The provided Makefile can be used to build individual parts (e.g. make part1) or
build all three parts together (make). In either case, the result will be a
binary in the "bin" directory and a .ppm image of the result in the "images"
directory.

Because I chose not to use OpenGL for this assignment, there are no external
dependencies for this project other than a C++11 compiler and the standard
library. I use OpenMP to shave a few seconds off the running time of Part 3, but
every somewhat-modern C++ compiler will have that capability built in. Running
all three parts shouldn't take more than a few seconds.

For Part 3, I used uniform sampling instead of random sampling to generate the
64 sample rays within each pixel--the results looked identical, and the uniform
sampling had better performance.

NOTE: I chose .ppm as my image format because it's the easiest format to write 
      to. However, it's possible that the default image viewer in Windows can't 
      open files of that type. I've included .png versions in the "images"
      directory just in case, but keep in mind that the code will still only
      produce .ppm files.
